= XYZ Reader

### Description
This is an RSS feed reader that initially did not follow Material Design Guidelines.  
I adjusted the appearance accordingly to create an immersive and visually appealing application.  
This project was built for the Udacity Android Developer nanodegree.

### What I accomplished in this project:

* Adjusted the colors and dimensions of an existing application to fit Material Design guidelines.
* Added simple transition animations between activities.
